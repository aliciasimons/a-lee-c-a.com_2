<div class="subheading">Summary </div>
  <div class="summary">

    Over the past few weeks I have found myself getting lost within different topics…
    lost is good. (I think) I kind of felt like Alice lost in Wonderland- falling down
    different holes, getting trapped in houses in pursuit of understanding things I don’t like.
    I’ve learnt a tonne about Gambling, Addiction, ‘Dangerous Design’ and have slowly made connections
   between them all. And each of these areas have lead me to where I am now.
   <br>
   <br>

<div class="subheading">Gambling</div>

<br>
<div class="summmary">
  Ahhhh Gambling. My fixation started with disgust at how the industry has slipped into sport so easily. Sponsoring everything- infiltrating stadiums but also coming into commercials and sports commentating. A public broadcast that goes into people’s homes- a private area. This advertising translated into different types of Gambling. Casinos. Apps. Pokies.
I drew parallels between each of them and became obsessed with asking questions
How can there be gambling ads everywhere? How much do we spend in Victoria? Australia?  What makes apps so addictive; is this a similar effect to going to a pokies venue? Who owns shares in gambling companies?
Lots of Questions. Some Answers- but ultimately relevant to where I want to go with my honours question but not necessarily a productive way to spend my time whilst formulating a question.

Within the structure of my Honours year I got to choose an Elective; I chose a class called ‘Unconventional Publishing’ run by Adam Cruickshank. Here, in this class I have being able to fuel my obsession with doing a project about gambling- I am going to different Pokies Venues and documenting the Environments I see. I’ll keep you posted on my progress- its been interesting so far.


Some not so fun stats to look at:

<div class="subheading">Addiction</div>

<div class="summary">
By looking into Gambling I found myself looking into addiction- as that is the biggest problem associated with Gambling. Just to be clear- I believe addiction is a chronic disease. The effects of addiction are deeply upsetting- and I believe prevention and stigma surrounding all kinds of addiction- whether that be gambling, drug, porn, social media needs to stop.
Within Addiction I watched A LOT of Ted Talks discussing how the brain works- what fuels addiction, what happens when we become addicted and how we can respond to people who are struggling with addiction. Overall I learnt a lot and this is something that is also relevant to my project however it hasn’t been particularly productive for my project at this stage in the process.

<div class="subheading">Designer Ethics/Dangerous Design:</div>

<div class="summary">
It was in Week 3 of Uni that I had a meeting with my Lecturer and we discussed everything I had found so far- he could see my frustration in learning about Gambling and how it causes addiction and instead of focussing on the effects on people he directed me back in the direction of design.
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="quote">"I've always thought that design and designers live by a moral code of conduct, almost like a doctor's Hippocratic Oath to do no harm," she said, explaining why she launched Design and Violence."</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="summary">
‘Design and Violence’ started as a Wordpress Site which eventually was turned into a book and later an exhibition. Created by Paola Antonelli, James Hunt and Michelle Millar Fisher the concept came about in response to Steven Pinker’s book ‘The Better Angels of Our Nature : A History of Violence and Humanity’ which discusses how today as a society we are the least violent we have ever been- essentially discussing how humanity has evolved over time. Around this same time the Blueprints for the Liberator- a 3D printed gun became available on the internet (Thankyou Cody Wilson)- this astounded Paola and lead her to curate this exhibition discussing how violence and design has evolved since 2001. A key idea behind this concept is how we might be physically less violent- but our violence has translated across in other mediums. For example internet Algorithms spreading hateful propaganda, Trump attempting to set up a Wall, Hostile Architecture designed to injure people.

The idea that design can and does become dangerous was an interesting concept that linked together all the research I had looked into surrounding Gambling- as something that could be considered fun has been placed in the hands of greedy evil people- who have employed DESIGNERS to make their ideas come to life and thus resulting in the rise of addiction.
This has lead me to where I am now- looking further into the concept what happens when all forms of design become dangerous in intent and the repercussions of how that affects people.
